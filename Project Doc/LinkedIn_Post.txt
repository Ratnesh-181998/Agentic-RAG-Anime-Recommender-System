🚀 Excited to share my latest AI/ML project: Agentic RAG Anime Recommender System

🎯 THE CHALLENGE
Traditional recommendation systems rely on rigid category-based filtering, failing to capture the nuanced emotional depth and atmospheric qualities that make content truly resonate with users.

✨ THE SOLUTION
I've built a production-grade Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that understands semantic intent and provides reasoned recommendations with full explainability.

🔬 TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

🧠 AI/ML Architecture:
• Semantic Search powered by 384-dimensional vector embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
• Groq LPU acceleration for ultra-low latency LLM inference (~240 TPS)
• ChromaDB with HNSW indexing for sub-10ms nearest neighbor search
• LangChain orchestration for agentic reasoning workflows

⚡ Performance Benchmarks:
• Vector Search: ~12ms (Target: <20ms) ✅
• LLM Inference: ~240 tokens/sec (Groq-optimized)
• UI Load Time: ~1.4s
• Scale: Tested with 14k+ records

☁️ LLMOps & Infrastructure:
• Docker containerization with Kubernetes (K8s) orchestration
• CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
• Deployed on GCP (GKE) with Grafana observability
• Real-time logging with IST timezone synchronization

🎨 Production Features:
• Multi-tab Streamlit Premium UI with real-time feedback
• Persistent query history with export functionality
• Live system logs with filtering (INFO/SUCCESS/ERROR)
• 16 pre-configured semantic categories for quick exploration

💡 KEY INNOVATION
Unlike traditional content-based filtering, this system provides a "reasoning layer" - explaining WHY each recommendation matches the user's emotional and thematic intent. Try queries like: "Find me an anime that feels like a lonely evening in a cyberpunk city"

🎓 Key Learnings:
1. Semantic embeddings dramatically outperform keyword-based search for subjective queries
2. Groq's LPU architecture delivers 10x faster inference vs traditional GPU deployments
3. Agentic workflows with explainability build user trust in AI recommendations

🔮 Future Roadmap:
• Multimodal search (image-based queries)
• Streaming token responses
• Hybrid RAG (collaborative + content-based filtering)

Open to discussions on RAG architectures, LLMOps best practices, and production AI deployment strategies!
